# Arnold for Blender Manual

Welcome to the Arnold for Blender manual!

Arnold for Blender—or BtoA—is an open-source, community-driven project licensed under the GPL. Our goal is to deliver the same feature-film quality production tools enjoyed by Maya, Houdini, 3DS Max, and other programs to Blender, while still preserving the same "Blender experience" we've all come to know and love.

As the pipeline workhorse at [Luna Digital, Ltd.](https://www.lunadigital.tv), BtoA is tested daily on real projects with real clients in both advertising and indie feature film.

## Legal
Arnold for Blender (BtoA) is licensed under the GPL v3. It is and will always be freely available to download and use.

Rendering in Arnold without a watermark requires a valid license from Autodesk, which can be purchased at a reasonable cost through [their website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/arnold/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription).
