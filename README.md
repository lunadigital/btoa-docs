# BtoA Manual

Welcome to the source repo for the Arnold for Blender (BtoA) manual! If you're a contributor, here is some quick info to get you up and running.

## Dependencies

The BtoA manual requires [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which can be installed via pip.

```
pip3 install mkdocs
```

## Running the development server

When you're working on documentation, it's helpful to see the site running in a web browser. MkDocs provides a tool for us to do that. Simply run `mkdocs serve` in a terminal window, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser of choice to view the docs. MkDocs will automatically detect when you save a file and will automatically refresh the page for you.
